00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.760
We propose LAPIG, a language guided

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.000
projector image generation method with

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.640
surface adaptation and stylization.

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.240
LAPIG consists of a projector-camera

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.120
system and a target textured projection

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.840
surface.

7
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.080
From this slide, we can see real captured

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.560
compensation and desired effect look

9
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.600
different just because of the physical

10
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.880
limitations although using the latest

11
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.440
compensation techniques. LAPIG's key

12
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.600
challenge is that due to projectors'

13
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.560
physical brightness limitation and the

14
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.000
surface texture, the viewer perceived

15
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.920
projection may suffer from color

16
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.840
saturation and artifacts in both dark and

17
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.120
bright regions, such that even with the

18
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.040
state-of-the-art projector compensation

19
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.520
techniques, the viewer may see clear

20
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.680
surface texture-related artifacts.

21
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.320
Therefore, how to generate a projector

22
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.440
image that follows the user's instruction

23
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.640
while also displays minimum surface

24
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.640
artifacts is an open problem.

25
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.360
To address this issue, we propose

26
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.440
projection surface adaptation that can

27
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.160
generate compensable surface stylization.

28
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.040
This slide shows the effect of whether or

29
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.440
not PSA is applied on the generated

30
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.640
stylized image and the final

31
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.440
visualization. Clearly, PSA can

32
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.960
adapt the stylization to the surface by

33
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.760
showing less discrepancies between the

34
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.440
target stylized surface and the real

35
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.280
captured projection. This

36
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.600
slide shows the effect of whether or not

37
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.200
PSA is applied on another surface.

38
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.830
In this section, we showed the visual

39
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.070
effects of whole process in our work.

40
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.560
Before stylized projection to projector,

41
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.760
we will perform PSA process to optimize

42
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.160
the stylized image. We can see in this

43
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
image on the far left the iterative

44
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.320
optimization process with project and

45
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.200
capture simulation and compensation, and

46
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.040
observe the change in the inferred

47
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.760
capture projection. When optimized,

48
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.320
target textured surface will go through

49
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.080
stylization by projector.

50
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.080
This slide shows a slower LAPIG process.

51
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.520
This slide shows how we made Mona Lisa

52
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.080
smile.

53
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.010
This slide shows how turn the surface

54
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.010
looks like Minecraft style.

55
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.270
This slide shows more results.

56
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.500
Thank you for watching!
